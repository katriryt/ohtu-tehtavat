# Retrospective techniques

Purpose of this document is to summarize two common retrospective techniques: [Glad, Sad, Mad]( http://retrospectivewiki.org/index.php?title=Glad,_Sad,_Mad) and [Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of Wheel]( http://retrospectivewiki.org/index.php?title=Start,_Stop,_Continue,_More_of,_Less_of_Wheel) for future reference.

**Glad, Sad, Mad** is straightforward approach where participants separately write a few observations regarding any topic, e.g., “task descriptions are not clear”, from the sprint on e.g., post-it notes. Each note is put on a board under Glad, Sad, or Mad category. Similar issues are grouped and topics to be discussed are voted on (max 5 votes / person). Facilitator leads the discussion, focusing it on actions to be performed in the next sprint. (Max 60 mins)

In **Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of Wheel**, a facilitator draws a circle with headlines for the mentioned five categories. He/she captures points raised by team members on the sprint under each category. In large groups, topics raised can be focused on the entire project, a certain iteration, or specific step in the process. In the end, actions to be taken are discussed and agreed on (Estimated time: 10-25 mins depending on group size)
